## Roadmap

As of writing this the code is, well.. Pretty terrible. There's lots of things that
should be done before a first release.

- [x] It works! Basic proof of concept
- [ ] Implement other aggregators, in no particular order
  - [x] Binance
  - [x] Kucoin
  - [ ] Bybit
  - [x] Bitfinex
  - [ ] Huobi
  - [ ] Coinbase
  - [ ] Kraken
- [ ] Refactor code.. A ton of refactoring
- [ ] Abstractions, abstractions, abstractions. Rewriting code is tedious
- [ ] Improve sorting and filtering.
